    <!-- Chapters with New Content -->
    <h2 id="Chapter1">Chapter 1 – Introduction to Web Foundations</h2>
    <p>
        The first chapter lays the foundation of how the web actually works. A website is 
        nothing more than a collection of files stored on servers, which the browser 
        requests and displays. Understanding this flow is important for any developer.

        In this chapter, we also explore HTML, which forms the structure of a webpage. 
        Every visual element—text, buttons, images, links—is created using tags. Once the 
        structure is ready, CSS is used to style the layout and make it visually appealing.
    
        By the end of Chapter 1, the student gains a clear idea of how a browser loads a 
        webpage, what a front-end environment is, and why MERN stack developers must 
        master HTML and CSS before moving into advanced JavaScript frameworks.

    <h2 id="Chapter2">Chapter 2 – Getting Started with JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        Chapter 2 focuses on JavaScript—the brain of every modern website. JavaScript adds 
        logic, interactivity, and real-time capability to web pages. Without it, websites 
        would be static and unable to respond to user actions.
    
        The chapter begins with variables, data types, operators, and conditional 
        statements. It then moves on to loops and functions, which are the building blocks 
        of dynamic programming. You also learn how JavaScript interacts with the DOM 
        to modify HTML elements.
   
        By completing this chapter, learners understand how to handle events such as 
        button clicks, keyboard input, and form submissions—skills essential for building 
        interactive applications.

    <h2 id="Chapter3">Chapter 3 – Beginning the MERN Journey</h2>
    <p>
        Chapter 3 marks the transition into the MERN stack. The chapter begins with 
        understanding what MERN stands for—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js—and 
        how each component plays a unique role in full-stack development.
    
        Learners start by setting up Node.js and understanding the importance of npm. 
        You will also learn how JavaScript is used on the backend with Node.js to handle 
        servers, routing, and responses.
    
        Along with backend basics, this chapter introduces React—the most popular 
        front-end library for building dynamic UIs. You learn what components are, how 
        data flows through props and state, and how React makes web apps faster.
    
        By the end of this chapter, students have a clear picture of how front-end and 
        back-end communicate, preparing them for deeper MERN development.
